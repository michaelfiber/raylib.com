**raylib is a simple and easy-to-use library to enjoy videogames programming.**

raylib is heavily inspired by Borland BGI graphics lib and by XNA framework.

raylib could be useful for prototyping, tools development, graphic applications, embedded systems and education.

NOTE for ADVENTURERS: raylib is a programming library to enjoy videogames programming; 
no fancy interface, no visual helpers, no auto-debugging... just coding in the most 
pure spartan-programmers way. Are you ready to learn? Jump to [code examples!](https://www.raylib.com/examples.html)
